# How does Inflation affect the Stock Market?

The stock market is a dynamic environment with dramatic changes that provide investors with favourable or negative indicators of stock market returns. Inflation is an important macroeconomic factor that has significant effects on the economy and the stock market in particular. When an economy's inflation rate is high, the actual worth of money falls, resulting in lower buying power, lower profitability, and lower real returns on investments (AboulSoud, 2018).

The purpose of this project is:

“Impact of inflation on stock market indices using data from 1980 through 2020”

The findings in the pdf are from a model in STATA and the following conclusion is based on python models.

# The final Equation

$$IndexPrice_{index, year}\\ = 3.8 - 5.15*InflationRate_{index, year} + 3.8$$
